# Introduction/Business Problem
A real estate development and investment company is trying to identify and shortlist retail opportunities in the Greater Toronto area based on trends and popularity. How can the company use social trends to select popular venues, identify characteristics of the venues, and pick new locations with similar characteristics has high growth potential?
# Data
I plan to use the following data sets:
1. Toronto neighborhoods from the weeks 3 exercise, i.e. Borough, Neighborhood, and coordinates
2. Foursquare Places API for Venues

Approach:
1. Combine the Neighborhoods and Foursquare venue data. This will leverage existing work from the Week 3 assignment.
2. Select the top 3 venues from combined data based on ratings.
3. Determine the category of the venues and the neighborhoods they are located.
4. Analyze characteristics of the neighborhoods.
5. Use clustering to find neighborhoods with similar characteristics.
6. Search for venues by categories identified (step 3) in the neighborhoods (step 5).
7. Analyze venues by relevant information, characteristics and ratings.
8. Develop recommendation based on analysis and data points.
